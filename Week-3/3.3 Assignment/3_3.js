//EXPLANATION- 
// The output is "Count is 0". It is because when createIncrement() is called, it returns the increment and log functions and creates the message and count variables.
//As the message is declared in the parent(createStack) function, its value remains unchanged and it gets the count as 0 itself. 
//To get the count as 3, we can move the message declaration inside the count function- in that way it will get the updated count during the time of execution.
// We can also say that there is no logic written in the code that changes the message string everytime the count is changed - 
//so the message string is created exactly once in the starting and its value is never changed.
