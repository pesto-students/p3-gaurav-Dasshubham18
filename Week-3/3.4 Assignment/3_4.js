  stack.print(); //prints all the items in the stack
  
  // EXPLANATION - 
  //Firstly, the items array was returned from the functiom itself and that was the reason due to which items array was accessible outside of the createStack function scope. 
  //I changed it and placed the items array inside function but did not return it. 
  //So, due to closure, we can only access items array inside of createStack function but nowhere outside it. 
  //Instaed, I created a print() function so that the user can see what items are there in the array without accessing it.
